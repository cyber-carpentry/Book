# Chapter 2 Collaboration

Proposed Chapter Outline:
- Introduction
	- What does it mean to collaborate?
	- What tools are available to us?
	- Are all tools good tools? 
	- Can we repurpose old tools?
	
- Sections
	- Not sure if this was just a title where Concepts, Best Practices, etc were suggested sections.

- Concepts
	- Science has become interdisciplinary. This means we are bringing experts from different domain specific areas. 
	- Science is more global. Meaning people are collaborating from different regions, timezones, etc. How do we create a workflow that not only allows this collaboration, but that can take advantage of it.
	
- Best Practices
	- Having office hours (semester course style)
	- Breakfast Carpentry (workshop style)
	
- Tools and Methods
	- Slack
	- GitHub Projects, Teams
	- Trello boards
	
- Final Example(s) 
	- May be part of running examples through the chapter.
	- Collaboration on writing this chapter may be the running example.
	- Screenshots, project boards

From Raja Introduction Chapter:
Chapter 2 is concerned with the socio-technical aspect of the FPF RLC. FPF is highly multi-disciplinary and multilateral involving several groups with different expertise and different background. Science has become very complicated and with the data-driven paradigm, the skillset needed to perform research requires expertise in statistics, mathematics, computer science apart from several disciplinary sciences. Hence collaboration and project coordination are central to FPF RLC. Even small projects are becoming multi-disciplinary needing diverse skill sets which needs that researchers need to be versed in dealing with  data preparation, computing operations, using the proper software and coding as needed to attain the results â€“ these in addition to being experts in their own domain and sub discipline. There are multiple reasons for collaboration and cooperation among scientific teams. They not only provide interchange of complementary expertise but also provide deep insights from one discipline into another. Many a time, fresh insights provide a view that can be helpful in tacking a problem in a novel manner (and get out of the rut of a tunnel vision). Collaboration also provides a means to build a strong team that can tackle Scientific Grand Challenge and Frontier Science problems and develop projects that are of larger scale and need a larger budget than can be done by individual researchers.  

Cooperation is integral to collaboration and is based on communication. Communication in a larger group not only requires facilities for performing exchange of ideas (many a time with remote partners) but also speaking a common vocabulary. Even within a discipline there are problems with common lexicons and that is exacerbated when dealing with multiple disciplines. Providing tools and techniques to bridge this gap is central (not just at the communication level) is crucial for large group projects.

Chapter 2 outlines some of the core best practices for collaboration and coordination. Since large projects have multiple components, dealing with them from multiple perspectives are very much needed. This chapter also will discuss ways to prepare scientists to deal with their collaboration and cooperation problems from a holistic perspective.  The chapter will also discuss many tools that are currently available for collaboration and coordination. These tools are given as examples as they rapidly change every few years as new tools are developed and become popular.
