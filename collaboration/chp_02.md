# Chapter 2 Collaboration

Proposed Chapter Outline:
- Introduction
	- What does it mean to collaborate?
	- What tools are available to us?
	- Are all tools good tools? 
	- Can we repurpose old tools?
	
- Sections
	- Not sure if this was just a title where Concepts, Best Practices, etc were suggested sections.

- Concepts
	- Science has become interdisciplinary. This means we are bringing experts from different domain specific areas. 
	- Science is more global. Meaning people are collaborating from different regions, timezones, etc. How do we create a workflow that not only allows this collaboration, but that can take advantage of it.
	
- Best Practices
	- Having office hours (semester course style)
	- Breakfast Carpentry (workshop style)
	
- Tools and Methods
	- Slack
	- GitHub Projects, Teams
	- Trello boards
	
- Final Example(s) 
	- May be part of running examples through the chapter.
	- Collaboration on writing this chapter may be the running example.
	- Screenshots, project boards
